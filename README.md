# Doctor App

Doctor App is a React-based web application designed for doctors to manage their patients, appointments, chats, calls, and settings in one clean interface.

---

##  Application Structure

The Doctor App is organized into several key parts:

- **Pages**: Individual views corresponding to different routes:
  - `Login` â€” user authentication page.
  - `Appointments` â€” doctors can view and manage appointments.
  - `My Patients` â€” list and details of patients fetched from the API.
  - `Chats` â€” real-time messaging interface.
  - `Calls` â€” video or audio call functionality.
  - `Settings` â€” user and app preferences.

- **Components**:
  - `Navbar` â€” the navigation bar shown to authenticated users.
  - `PrivateRoute` â€” wrapper component protecting private pages from unauthorized access.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, React Router v6
- **UI Framework:** Material UI (MUI) components
- **Authentication & State:** React Context (`auth.context`)

---

The application utilizes the freely available API https://randomuser.me to fetch and display patient information dynamically.

Material UI (MUI) components have been implemented on the Login and My Patients pages to provide a consistent and responsive user interface.
