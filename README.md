# Doctor App

Doctor App is a React-based web application designed for doctors to manage their patients, appointments, chats, calls, and settings in one clean interface.

##  Application Structure

The Doctor App is organized into several key parts:

- **Pages**: Individual views corresponding to different routes:
  - `Login` â€” user authentication page.
  - `Appointments` â€” doctors can view appointments and patient's infos.
  - `My Patients` â€” list and details of patients fetched from the API.
  - `Chats` â€” real-time messaging interface (in progress).
  - `Calls` â€” video or audio call functionality (in progress).
  - `Settings` â€” user and app preferences (in progress).

- **Components**:
  - `Navbar` â€” the navigation bar shown to authenticated users.
  - `PrivateRoute` â€” wrapper component protecting private pages from unauthorized access.

The application utilizes the freely available API https://randomuser.me to fetch and display patient information dynamically.

Material UI (MUI) components have been implemented on the Login and My Patients pages to provide a consistent and responsive user interface.
